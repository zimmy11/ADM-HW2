# Homework 2 - Videogames Reviews

The purpose of this project was to conduct **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) on a [Steam's dataset of reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/najzeko/steam-reviews-2021) and to answer to some questions.

The repository contains the following files:
1. __`main.ipynb`__:
  > A Jupyter Notebook where we summarize all the answers for the **Research and Algorithmic Questions**
2. __`functions.py`__:
  > A python script where we have defined many functions we have used in the `main.ipynb`
3. __`algoritmic_input.txt`__:
  > A text file where we extract the values to test the Algorithmic question in the `main.ipynb`
